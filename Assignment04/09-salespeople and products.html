9) Use a two-dimensional array to solve the following problem: A company has four salespeople (1 to 4) who sell five different products (1 to 5). Once a day, each salesperson passes in a slip for each different type of product actually sold. Each slip contains a) the salesperson number, b) the product number, and c) the total dollar value of the product sold that day. Thus, each salesperson passes in between zero and five sales slips per day. Assume that the information from all of the slips for last month is available. Write a script that will read all this information for last month’s sales and summarize the total sales by salesperson by product. All totals should be stored in the two-dimensional array sales. After processing all the information for last month, display the results in an XHTML table format, with each of the columns representing a different salesperson and each of the rows representing a different product. Cross-total each row to get the total sales of each product for last month; cross-total each column to get the total sales by salesperson for last month. Your tabular printout should include these cross-totals to the right of the totaled rows and to the bottom of the totaled columns.
