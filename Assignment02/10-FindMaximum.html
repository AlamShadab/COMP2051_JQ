10) The process of finding the largest value (i.e. the maximum of a group of values) is used frequently
 in computer applications. For example, a script that determines the winner of a sales contest would
 input the number of units sold by each salesperson. The salesperson who sells the most units wins the content.
 Write a script that inputs a series of 10 single-digit numbers as characters {eg. 6, 7, 3, 6, 4, 2, 5, -7, 1, 2}
 determines the largest of the numbers, and outputs a message that displays the largest number.
 
 Your script should use three variables: counter, number (the current digit input to the script,
 largest (the largest number found so far). Note that you can also change the program to be sentinel
 controlled to end whenever the user specifies, dealing with an unspecified data range.
