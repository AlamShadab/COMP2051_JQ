8) A large company pays its salespeople on a commission basis. The salespeople receive $200 per week,
 plus 9 percent of their gross sales for the week. For example, a salesperson who sells $5000 worth of
 merchandise in a week receives $200 plus 9 percent of $5,000, or a total of $650.
 You have been supplied with a list of the items sold by each salesperson. The value of these items
 are as follows:
Item Value
1    239.99
2    129.75
3     99.95
4    350.89
Develop a script that inputs one salesperson’s items sold for last week, calculates the salesperson’s
earnings, and outputs HTML5 text that displays the salesperson’s earnings.

       var acum = 0;
       var currItem;
       for (var i=0; i<arrPrices.length; i++){
         do {
	         currItem = parseFloat(prompt("Please type the number of items code "+(i+1)+"sold.",""));
         }while(isNaN(currItem));
         acum += currItem*arrPrices[i];
       }
       document.getElementById("output").innerHTML="The sales person sold $ "+parseFloat(acum).toFixed(2).toString()+".<br>"+
         "Base payment: $"+parseFloat(base).toFixed(2)+"<br> Comission: $"+parseFloat(acum*0.09).toFixed(2)+"<br> Total Payment: $"+parseFloat(base+acum*(0.09)).toFixed(2)+"<br>";
